<p> For my website, I have implemented several different techniques that go beyond basic requirements of this assignment:</p>
<ol> 
     <li> <p>The first technique is an image map. Using HTML image maps feature, I could display many images that link to websites where everyone could learn
	 about firewalls.<a href="topic.html#learningresources">Here is where you could find it and see.</a> </p>
	 <p> I have learned this feature from this website: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp"> https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp</a></p>
	 <p> Also, here is code parts that I have used for this feature:</p>
	 <figure>
     <img src="images/imagemaps.png" alt="Image maps for learning resources" width="920" height="100">

      </figure></li>
	  
	  <li> <p> The second technique that I have used is CSS animation. By using CSS tags "@keyframes slidein", I have made all data on unordered lists move from 
	  outside to the position in 3 seconds, making the website more interactive.<a href="topic.html#differences"> Here is where you could find it.</a></p>
	  <p> I find out about this technique on this website: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations"> 
	  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations</a></p>
	  <p> Here is the code parts for CSS animation: </p>

</ol>
<p> I hope that you find out these new features on my webpage enjoyable and interesting.</p>
