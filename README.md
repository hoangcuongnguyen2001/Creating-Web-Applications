# Creating-Web-Applications
This is all the code written in tutorials of Creating Web Applications unit in Swinburne University (where you learn about making a simple website using HTML, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL). There are 3 assignments, 2 of which are placed in this repository (the third one could be considered the final project of the unit and is put in Firewall-Technology repository).
